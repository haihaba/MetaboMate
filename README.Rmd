####**All you need for NMR-based metabolic profiling with R!**


***

The R toobox covers all basic processing and analysis steps, including:

* **Data Import**
    * Fast read-in of 1D NMR spectra in Bruker file format
    * Metadata for each sample
        * Spectrometer-related acquisition parameters (eg. frequency, pulse program, receiver gain)
        * Pre-processing details (eg. time of acquisition, number or data points in time domain, selected AU program)
        <br>
        <br>

* **Spectral Quality Assessment**
    * Detection of baseline distortions 
    * Water suppression - quality index
    * Effectiveness shimming / magnetic field homogeneiety using TSP line widths
    * Signal to noise estimation
       <br>
        <br>

* **Data Pre-Processing** 
    * Referencing to external standard (TSP) or glucose, 
    * Non-linear baseline correction, 
    * Easy excision of spectral areas (eg. residual water) 
       <br>
        <br>
* **Sample Normalisation**
    * Total area normalisation
    * Probablistic quotient normalisation (PQN)
       <br>
        <br> 
* **Multivariate Analysis and Statistics**
    * Principal Comenent Analysis (PCA), including Hotelling's T^2^ statistic
    * Distance to Model in X space (detection of moderate outliers)
    * Orthogoanal-Patial Least Squares (O-PLS) regression and discriminant analysis
    * Single or multi-column Y for O-PLS
       <br>
        <br>

Statistical model interpretation is supported by aestethically pleasing visualisations using ggplot2.

Many of the provided functions can also be applied to mass spectrometry data. 

All functions are well-documented, assessible with the `help()` function in R.
